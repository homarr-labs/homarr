We've been working hard to offer Homarr in many languages. The next update of Homarr will be using [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) to translate almost any part of your Dashboard.

### We need your help
![](img/homarr-we-need-you.webp) <br/>
Yes, we need **YOU**! We want to make Homarr accessible to as many people as possible. Thus, we need to translate all content into many different languages. We need your help for that! [You can help us now to translate Homarr into as many languages as possible](/docs/community/translations).

### About global translations / translations per user

We are aware that many people would like to configure translations globally or configure language per user. Currently, translations are stored in the Cookies, which will expire after some time (currently, it's set to 30 days). We will implement more granular language settings in future versions of Homarr, since it requires major changes to Homarr. Stay tuned! 😎
