## Icon picker
Icons in Homarr are automatically requested from multiple sources:
  - [Dashboard Icons](https://dashboardicons.com/) - Our recommended source with over 1888+ curated, high-quality icons
  - [selfh.st icons](https://github.com/selfhst/icons)
  - [Simple icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons)
  - [Tabler icons](https://tabler-icons.io/)
  - [Papirus icons](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme)
  - [Homelab Svg assets](https://github.com/loganmarchione/homelab-svg-assets)
  - **Local icons**: automatically fetched from the [medias feature](/docs/management/media/)

Using these icon sources, Homarr provides a total collection of over 11,000 icons at your fingertips.
The icon picker is a fast searcher that helps you to find your desired icon simply by entering a search term.

### Finding Missing Icons

If you can't find the icon you're looking for in Homarr's built-in picker, we strongly recommend checking [Dashboard Icons](https://dashboardicons.com/). It offers a modern, user-friendly interface and a curated collection of high-quality icons specifically designed for dashboards and app directories.

Icons that are high quality and printable ([SVG](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)) are marked with a red badge "SVG" at the top right.

### Using external icons
If you don't find the icon you're looking for on Dashboard Icons or wish to use a different source, you can simply enter a URL that points to an icon.
It is important that the URL directly points to the file without any advertisements or elements around it.
