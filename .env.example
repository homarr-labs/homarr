# Keep this file up-to-date when you add new variables to \`.env\`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any secrets in it.

# This is how you can use the sqlite driver:
DB_DRIVER='better-sqlite3'
DB_URL='FULL_PATH_TO_YOUR_SQLITE_DB_FILE'

# Those are the two ways to use the mysql2 driver:
# 1. Using the URL format:
# DB_DRIVER='mysql2'
# DB_URL='mysql://user:password@host:port/database'
# 2. Using the connection options format:
# DB_DRIVER='mysql2'
# DB_HOST='localhost'
# DB_PORT='3306'
# DB_USER='username'
# DB_PASSWORD='password'
# DB_NAME='name-of-database'

# The below path can be used to store trusted certificates during development, it is not required and can be left empty.
# If it is used, please use the full path to the directory where the certificates are stored.
