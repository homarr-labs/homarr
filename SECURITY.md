# Security Policy
This policy is relevant if you found potential vulnerabilities in an audit.
We consider something as a vulnerability if it...
1. puts users or user data at risk
2. enables third parties to gain control or access (e.g. [RATs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_desktop_software#RAT), [privilege escalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation), ...)
3. abuses the system in an unintended way (e.g. crypto mining, proxy, ...)

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| >1.0.0  | :white_check_mark: |
| <1.0.0  | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We use [GitHub's system for reporting vulnerabilities](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory).
Click [**here to report an advisory**](https://github.com/homarr-labs/homarr/security/advisories/new). Our team will get notified and will get back to you within 1-6 business days.

As a general guideline; please provide as much detail as possible and provide reproduction steps / documentation regarding the re-creation.
You may also provide a fork with a fix for the vulnerability.
See https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Vulnerability_Disclosure_Cheat_Sheet.html for guidelines regarding disclosure.

If you're unable / unwilling (or it's not safe) to disclose vulnerabilites via GitHub, please report them with the subject "Security advisory - CVEXXX" to our email homarr-labs@proton.me.
Please never disclose security vulnerabilits on your own publicly - we'd like to search for a dimplomatic solution that is also safe for our users.

In your initial contact with us, please provide details according to the [OWASP guidelines for initial reports](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Vulnerability_Disclosure_Cheat_Sheet.html#initial-report).

Thank you!
We're looking forward to your report
